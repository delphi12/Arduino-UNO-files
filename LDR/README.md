# Light Dependent Resistor (LDR)

An LDR sensor, or photoresistor, is a variable resistor that changes its resistance based on the intensity of light falling on it.

LDRs are made of semiconductor materials such as cadmium sulfide (CdS) or cadmium selenide (CdSe). These materials have a property called photoconductivity, where their electrical conductivity increases with light exposure.

The LDR typically has a zigzag or serpentine pattern of cadmium sulfide deposited on a ceramic substrate. This increases the surface area for light absorption.

**Working Principle**

*Dark State:*

- In darkness or low-light conditions, the material has few free electrons, resulting in high resistance (often in the mega ohm range).

*Light State:*

- When exposed to light, photons strike the material, exciting electrons and creating more charge carriers. This reduces the resistance, often to a few hundred ohms in bright light.

The resistance change is inversely proportional to the intensity of light.

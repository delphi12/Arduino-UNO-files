# Motor with Arduino
This project will show how to control a motor using an Arduino Uno and an L9110 motor control board. The process of connecting and controlling a motor, demonstrating the basic principles of motor operation and control in Arduino projects.

**TT Motor:**

- A TT motor is a type of DC motor that has a gearbox attached to it. 
- The gearbox reduces the speed of the motor and increases its torque. 
- A TT motor is commonly used in applications such as driving wheels, propellers, fans, among others. 
- A TT motor has two wires: a positive wire and a negative wire. The positive wire is usually red and the negative wire is usually black.

**Components:**

1) Arduino UNO
2) TT Motor
3) L9110 Motor Driver Module
4) Bread board

**LCD with Ardunio:**

To display some characters and string in LCD using arduino. It invloves lot of wire connections and approprite 
library installation (If you have 16x2 LCD). Be patient and do it carefully. you might end up burning your LCD or Ardunio. My board configuration might not go with yours. check your device model and get the appropriate libraries and LCD address.

used this tutorial to find my I2C LCD address - Really helped a lot: https://www.make-it.ca/i2c-lcd-display-on-arduino/

Note: If you're using 16x2 LCD1602 or similar use also need potentiometer

**Components:**

1) I2C LCD
2) Arduino UNO
3) Breadboard

**Arduino PIN connections**

| I2C Pin | Arduino Pin |
|--------|--------|
| GND | GND |
| VCC | 5v |
| SDA | A4 |
| SCL | A5 |

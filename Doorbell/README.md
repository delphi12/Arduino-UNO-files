# Project Doorbell
**Introduction:**

To create a doorbell using buzzer and push button.

**Buzzers and working principle:**

- working principle: Buzzer has a piezo disk (piezo electric element), which vibrates/oscillates when voltage hits the positive terminal. 

- There are tow types of buzzers; Active and Passive buzzers. 
- An active buzzer has a built-in oscillating source, so it will make sounds when electrified. Active buzzer doesnâ€™t need a varying voltage, you just give it constant voltage and the internal chopper (oscillator) circuit that turns the constant voltage to a square wave and feeds that to the piezo disc to generate a fixed-frequency tone. 
 - A passive buzzer does not have such source, so it will not tweet if DC signals are used; instead, you need to use square waves whose frequency is between 2K and 5K to drive it.

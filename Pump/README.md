# Centrifugal Pump with Arduino
This project shows how to control a centrifugal pump with an Arduino Uno and an L9110 motor control board. To start the pump in one direction, run it for a specific duration.

**Centrifugal Pump:**

A centrifugal pump is a device that can move liquids from one place to another by using a rotating impeller. It can be used to pump water, oil, chemicals, etc. 

A centrifugal pump has two main parts: a motor and a pump. The motor provides power to the pump and the pump converts the rotational energy into pressure and flow.

**Note:** It tends to heat too much that thereâ€™s a risk of overheating if you turn it on unsubmerged.

**Components:**

1) Arduino UNO
2) Centrifugal Pump
3) L9110 Motor Driver Module
4) Bread board

Note: Instead of motor in the diagram, replace with Pump pins.
